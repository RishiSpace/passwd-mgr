# passwd-mgr
### A Simple CLI Password Manager that stores your passwords in an encrypted form
### the password.txt has been uploaded as a sample to demonstrate how the creds are saved

## NOTE: As mentioned earlier this is only a simple password manager and is in no way a replacement for an actual professional grade password manager. All passwords are saved locally on YOUR PC and therefore its security depends entirely on you :)
